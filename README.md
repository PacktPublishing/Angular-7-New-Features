# Angular-7-New-Features
This is the code repository for Angular-7-New-Features, published by <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/">Packt</a>. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.

# Description
This course will be quick, to the point and informative. It will cover each of the new features that the framework has to offer to developers. You will also get to know what makes it different from version 6 and earlier versions of the framework. Then, you will learn to install the new angular-cli on your machine. Also, you will get the hang of other cool features like Virtual Scrolling and Drag and Drop. 

# What You Will Learn
- Build an angular 7 app from scratch
- Use Angular Material to add styles to your app 
- Upgrade an angular 6 app to angular 7
- Create a new Angular 7 project with the angular-cli
- Install the new angular-cli globally on your machine
- Update an existing Angular 6 project to version 7

# Requirements
A good understanding of Web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and a basic knowledge of Angular framework, the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm, and Model-View-Controller (MVC) or the Model-View-View-Model (MVVM) architecture is expected.  Angular uses TypeScript as its main language so some knowledge of TypeScript is also expected.

# Installation Instructions
The source files do not include the <b>node_modules</b>.  Once a project is created using the Angular CLI, the <b>node_modules</b> will be created automatically.

To create a new Angular project with the Angular CLI
<pre>
ng new my-project-name
</pre>

To generate a new component, module, and service with the Angular CLI
<pre>
ng generate component mycomponent
ng generate module mymodule
ng generate service myservice
</pre>

The same commands above using short-hand notations
<pre>
ng g c mycomponent
ng g m mymodule
ng g s myservice
</pre>

After a project is created, swap in the content in the folder from each section.

Except for <b>Section 1.1</b> and <b>Section 1.2</b>, each section has a <b>Section x.y.Start</b> and <b>Section x.y.End</b> folder (where x = section number, y = subsection number.  Example:  <b>Section 1.3.Start</b>, <b>Section 1.3.End</b>).  The <b>Section x.y.Start</b> contains all the files in the state before the video starts and <b>Section x.y.End</b> contains all the files in the state after the video ends.
